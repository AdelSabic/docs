# General 
You can find there some basic conventions which affect multiple components.

## References Overview
Some components have to be referenced. This table will help you with that:



|Component	|Type	|solution.xml	|AppModule_managed.xml	|
|-	|-	|-	|-	|
|AppModule	|80	|GUID	|N/A	|
|Business Rule	|29	|GUID	|GUID	|
|Canvas App	|300	|schemaName	|schemaName	|
|Connection Role	|63	|N/A	|N/A	|
|Dashboard	|60	|GUID	|GUID	|
|Entity	|1	|schemaName	|schemaName	|
|Form	|60	|GUID	|GUID	|
|Flow	|29	|GUID	|N/A	|
|Option Set	|9	|schemaName	|N/A	|
|Plugin Assemblies	|91	|GUID	|N/A	|
|SDK Message Processing Step	|92	|GUID	|N/A	|
|Ribbon Diff	|55	|N/A	|N/A	|
|Security Role	|20	|GUID	|GUID (AppModuleRoleMaps)	|
|SiteMap	|62	|schemaName	|schemaName	|
|View	|26	|N/A	|schemaName	|
|WebResource	|61	|schemaName	|N/A	|
|Workflow	|29	|GUID	|N/A	|

Look at other projects if you struggle or ask seniors.

### **Behavior**
Behavior defines how the component will behave while being imported. 

`behavior="0"` - Takes whole definition of a component in solution and overrides other definitions of this component.

`behavior="1"` - Takes whole definition of a component in solution and merges this definition with other definitions of the same component.

`behavior="2"` - Takes only metadata of the component and merges them with other definitions of the same component.

More info bellow in **Conventions** section.

### **Solution action**
If you are making extensions of existing components in other solutions you will have to use `solutionaction` sometimes. 

`solutionaction="Added"` - The whole component or his part (used in FormXml defintiion) was added.

`solutionaction="Modified"` - The whole component or his part (used in FormXml defintiion) was modified.

`solutionaction="Removed"` - The whole component or his part (used in FormXml defintiion) was removed.

## Conventions

### **Version**
Every component with .xml file suffix contains paramater `<IntroducedVersion>`.
Please try to check this attribute and replace this attribute with 1.0.0.0 version while contributing.

**Example:**
```xml
<IntroducedVersion>1.0.0.0</IntroducedVersion>
```
___


### **GUID**
GUIDs are used for IDs of components. You have to be super cautious about this because duplicated GUIDs can use serious damage for system.

Example of GUID generator which you can use: [GUID GENERATOR](https://guidgenerator.com/online-guid-generator.aspx)

### **Behavior**
LetÂ´s make it simple. (This do not applies on field definitions!)

**Entity:** 
- Use `behavior="1"` while contributing in Talxis or adding brand new custom entity in PCT solution. 
- Use `behavior="2"` while extending an existing solution from Talxis in PCT. 

**Everything else:** 
- Use `behavior="0"` if needed.
