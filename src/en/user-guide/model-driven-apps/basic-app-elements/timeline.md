# Timeline

![Timeline](/.attachments/ModelDrivenAppUserGuide/timeline.png)

The timeline is used to store **activities** linked to a record. Almost every form contains a timeline.  Activities can be:

1) Appointment
2) Email
3) Phone call
4) Task

**Create activity from the timeline**

Example: We called with the customer (type of account) and we want to save it in the timeline so that we know when someone else opens the same record will no longer have to call the customer.

To create new activity, click **+** button. After pressing the button, a menu of activities will open from which you can choose. Select one and a quick create form will open.
