# Timeline
Almost every form contains a timeline. The timeline is used to store our activities with a given record.
Activities can be:

1) Appointment
2) Email
3) Phone call
4) Task

**_Example:_**
We called with the customer (type of account) and we want to save it in the timeline so that we know when someone else opens the same record will no longer have to call the customer.

To create new activity, click **+** button. After pressing the _button_, a menu of activities will open from which you can choose. Select one and a quick create form will open.
