# Track and manage activities

## Gain insights with dashboards
In the **Activities Overview** there is an overview of activities within the entire contact management. Here you can find your open activities for this week, open overdue activities, etc.

## Set scheduled follow-up activity
If you are creating an activity from a timeline, the scheduled follow-up activity is set automatically by filling in the regarding field. However, if you create a new activity outside the timeline, you have the option to set an entry in the **Regarding** field.

You can then see the upcoming event in the **Scheduled Follow-up section** or in **View**. 

This functionality is currently only available in **Sales application** for accounts and opportunities.

_Scheduled follow-up activity takes a while to load, try a refreshnut view or form._
