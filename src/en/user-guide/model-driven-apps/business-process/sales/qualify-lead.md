# How to qualify Lead
In the previous section, we showed you how to create a lead. We will now try to **qualify** him. As you can see at BPF, we are now in the Identify stage. We did identification in the previous section so we can click on the **Next stage** to move into Qualify stage.

After identifying a potential customer, we can proceed to qualification. In **_Qualify_** stage, we also try to find out details from a potential customer, such as the organization in which he works.

In the business process flow, the account is a mandatory field so it must be filled in in order to qualify our Lead. We can either create a new account or select an existing one.

After selecting / creating an account, its information will be displayed in the related records section.

**Disqualify Lead**

If Lead doesn't fit your expectations, you may disqualify him. You must state the reason for disqualification.

**Reactivate Lead**

After disqualification, the form will be locked. You cannot edit the data in the form. If you later want to work with Lead, you can reactivate it with the Reactivate button.
