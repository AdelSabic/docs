# Sales Business Process

The **Sales business process flow** can help you close more sales and achieve higher customer satisfaction. You can achieve more consistent sales interactions by following the sales process as it takes you through each stage, from creating a lead to closing the sale. You also end up with a more complete history, which you can refer to later on if you plan to work with your customer again in the future, or if your customer needs support.

A **Sales business process flow** is a set of repeatable steps that a sales person takes to take a prospective buyer from the early stage of awareness to a closed sale (Win or Lose). 

Typically, a sales process consists of 3-5 steps: **Identify**, **Qualify**, **Develop**, **Propose**, **Won**.

**Sales Process when created from Opportunity**

You can start the Sales process directly from Opportunity if you do not need to create a Lead. If you have created Lead, it is not a problem to create opportunities for it.
